(*
 * This problem set is a short script that prints out a 
 * survey and, if you wish, posts a message to a web server
 * so that you can see OCaml in action. 
 * Posting a message to the server is optional, and  
 * is only available as an exercise to those students
 * who have an @college.harvard.edu email address 
 * (required for authentication). 
 * All other students leave the post flag set to false.

 * To receive a key, visit http://pset0.ml/ and log in.
